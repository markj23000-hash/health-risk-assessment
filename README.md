# Health Risk Assessment System

Machine learning system that predicts health risk scores based on environmental data including air quality and weather conditions.

## Overview
Developed a predictive model to assess health risks from urban environmental factors, achieving high accuracy with R² of 0.973 using ensemble learning techniques.

## Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Model Details
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Performance: RMSE of 0.112, R² of 0.973
- Features: Temperature, humidity, PM2.5, NO2, wind speed, dew point, and other environmental variables

## Key Findings
- Strong correlation between environmental factors and health risk
- Dew point analysis reveals threshold patterns for high-risk conditions
- Model explains 97.3% of variance in health risk scores

## Results
The model successfully predicts health risk scores with high accuracy, enabling proactive public health decisions and early warning systems for adverse environmental conditions.
